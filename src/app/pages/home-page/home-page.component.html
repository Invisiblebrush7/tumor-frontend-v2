        <h3>Glioma</h3>
        <p>
          Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord.
          The cells in a glioma look similar to healthy brain cells called glial
          cells. Glial cells surround nerve cells and help them function. As a
          glioma grows it forms a mass of cells called a tumor

        <h3>Meningioma</h3>
        <p>
          A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges â€” the membranes
          that surround the brain and spinal cord. Although not technically a
          brain tumor, it is included in this category because it may compress
          or squeeze the adjacent brain, nerves and vessels.

        <h3>Pituitary</h3>
        <p>
          Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary
          gland. This gland is an organ about the size of a pea. It's located
          behind the nose at the base of the brain. Some of these tumors cause
          the pituitary gland to make too much of certain hormones that control
          important body functions. Others can cause the pituitary gland to make
          too little of those hormones.
